        Hi, Iâ€™m Rachel Green, a 38-year-old Civil Servant from Salford.  Iâ€™ve been feeling a bit stale in my current job, Iâ€™m a creative person and the civil service doesnâ€™t have much scope for that, so I want to pursue web development as it appeals to my creative side and hopefully future proofs me, not to mention the money (Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re aware of the strikes) and no night shifts (although I did stay up till 3am after being given the week 2 homework ðŸ˜‚).<br>
<br>
This site will hopefully become my portfolio, and my plan is to update as we go and add my CV etc.<br>
<br>
I was recently diagnosed with ADHD (finally-despite arguing with my GP for years and years that something wasnâ€™t right) and web development seems to have become a new obsession, but I have a feeling it will be sticking around for a while, like my love of excel.  I think I do like solving problems, googling to find the answer and using trial and error (thank God for ctrl+z).  I think the ADHD will help because I can easily go down rabbit holes and lose track of time.<br>
<br>
I live in Salford with my partner Clare and 3 pets Otis, Shelby and BrÃ¢n (I have given them their own page).  Thanks to years of undiagnosed ADHD, I have picked up and dropped many hobbies, over the years I have done jewellery making, polymer clay models, sewing, and photography amongst others that I canâ€™t even remember lol.  I really loved the photography and I want to get back into it as I really enjoyed it.
